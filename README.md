## 📘 Overview

`denoising_autoencoder` is a deep learning framework focused on **image denoising** using convolutional autoencoders. Developed with academic rigor, it is ideal for coursework, thesis projects, and research experiments.

Core objectives:

- **Deep noise reduction** — removing Gaussian, Poisson, or real-world noise.
- **Modular and transparent architecture** — easy to extend or compare models.
- **Visual and quantitative evaluation** — logging metrics and visual examples of denoised outputs.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Convolutional Autoencoder** with encoder–decoder layers.
- ✅ Support for multiple **noise types**: Gaussian, Poisson, etc.
- ✅ Training with **MSE**, **SSIM**, or custom loss functions.
- ✅ **TensorBoard logging** for visualizing loss, PSNR, and SSIM.
- ✅ **Jupyter demo notebook** to visually inspect denoising results.
- ✅ Modular code for adding new architectures or loss metrics.
